1. Ingesting Data in NiFi

NiFi is great for ingesting, processing, and routing data. Here's what you can do:
NiFi Workflow Ideas:

    Ingest and Transform JSON Files:
        Use NiFi to ingest the JSON files, split the JSON data, and enrich or clean it.
        Extract key data like dates, open/close prices, event types, and impact factors.
        Route records based on event type (e.g., Climate, Social, Governance).

    Add Sentiment Analysis:
        Integrate NiFi with external APIs (like Azure or Google NLP) to perform sentiment analysis on ESG event descriptions (e.g., CEO scandal, protests).
        Add a sentiment score for each event and enrich your dataset before pushing it downstream.

    Generate Alerts or Notifications:
        Set up conditional logic in NiFi that triggers when certain event types or extreme price fluctuations are detected.
        For instance, you could trigger notifications when stock prices fall by more than 5% due to a governance event.

    Streaming Data (NiFi + Kafka):
        You could stream this stock data through NiFi using Kafka, simulating real-time stock price updates based on random or scheduled ESG events.

NiFi Processors to Use:

    GetFile/ListenFTP (Ingest files)
    SplitJson (Break down each JSON record)
    EvaluateJsonPath (Extract specific fields)
    RouteOnAttribute (Route based on event type or price thresholds)

2. Analyzing the Data in Scala (Apache Zeppelin)

Once you’ve ingested the data into a database or a Kafka topic, you can use Scala in Zeppelin to do some insightful data analysis. Here are some interesting analyses you can perform:
Scala Zeppelin Use Cases:

    Stock Price Volatility by ESG Event Type:
        Use Scala to calculate the stock price volatility over time and analyze how different types of events (Climate, Social, Governance) impact volatility.
        Visualize stock price fluctuations before, during, and after major ESG events.

    scala

val esgEvents = df.filter($"event_type".isNotNull)
val volatility = esgEvents.groupBy("event_type")
  .agg(stddev("close").as("price_volatility"))
display(volatility)

Correlation Between Event Severity and Stock Price Impact:

    Analyze the correlation between impact factor (from ESG events) and the stock price changes.
    Determine if certain event types (e.g., Governance events) have a more significant impact on stock prices than others.

scala

val correlation = df.stat.corr("impact_factor", "close")
println(s"Correlation between event severity and stock price: $correlation")

Event Frequency and Stock Movement Analysis:

    Count the frequency of each event type and analyze how frequently different ESG events occur and their average impact on stock price.
    You could further analyze whether a higher frequency of social events leads to more sustained stock price changes.

scala

val eventFrequency = df.groupBy("event_type")
  .agg(count("event_type").as("frequency"), avg("impact_factor").as("avg_impact"))
display(eventFrequency)

Sentiment Analysis on ESG Events (if added in NiFi):

    If you used NiFi to add sentiment scores to the ESG event descriptions, you can perform sentiment analysis:
        Correlation between sentiment and stock price changes.
        Events with the highest negative or positive sentiment and their impacts on stock volatility.

scala

val sentimentCorrelation = df.stat.corr("sentiment_score", "close")
display(sentimentCorrelation)

ESG Event-Driven Price Prediction:

    Use machine learning libraries like Spark MLlib to create predictive models based on the historical ESG events and their impact on stock prices.
    This could predict future stock price movements when a new event occurs (e.g., if a new CEO resigns or a climate disaster happens).

You could train a model using LinearRegression or RandomForestRegressor from Spark MLlib.

scala

    import org.apache.spark.ml.regression.LinearRegression

    // Prepare data
    val features = df.select("impact_factor", "volume", "open", "close")
    val lr = new LinearRegression()
      .setLabelCol("close")
      .setFeaturesCol("features")

    val model = lr.fit(trainingData)
    val predictions = model.transform(testData)
    display(predictions)

3. Visualizations in Zeppelin

Visualizing these analyses can provide quick insights:

    Stock Price over Time with event annotations (use scatter plots to highlight key ESG events).
    Stock Price Volatility by Event Type: Show how volatility spikes during governance, climate, or social events.
    Volume of Trades During Major ESG Events: Highlight changes in trading volume during key events.

scala

val stockPriceOverTime = df.select("date", "close")
display(stockPriceOverTime)

scala

val eventVolatility = df.groupBy("event_type")
  .agg(stddev("close").as("volatility"))
display(eventVolatility)

4. Data Aggregations and Insights

You can use Scala in Zeppelin to create meaningful aggregations:

    Daily average price vs. ESG event occurrence.
    Moving average (e.g., 7-day or 30-day) of stock prices and how that correlates with ESG events.
    Yearly impact analysis: Aggregate stock price and volume trends based on the number of ESG events in a given year.

scala

val movingAvg = df.withColumn("30_day_avg", avg("close").over(Window.orderBy("date").rowsBetween(-30, 0)))
display(movingAvg)

5. Scenario Simulation (Hypothetical ESG Events)

You can create hypothetical future scenarios by simulating "what-if" ESG events:

    What if there’s a new climate law?
    What happens if the company faces another governance crisis?
    Simulate various outcomes using different event probabilities and severities in Scala.
