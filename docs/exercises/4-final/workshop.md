# Exercise 4: Putting It All Together

### Objective:
Combine all components into a fully functional and scalable data pipeline.

### Steps:
1. **Integrate All Components:**
    - Ensure seamless data flow from NiFi to Kafka, processed by Spark, and stored in Minio.
    - Set up Superset to visualize real-time data.

2. **Demonstrate End-to-End Functionality:**
    - Ingest new data and observe how it flows through the entire pipeline.
    - Monitor the pipeline's behavior under different loads.
